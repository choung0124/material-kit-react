    alt: "It's the second day of Christmas ! hmmm actually I have a confession to make. I used to quite like reading books by Haruki Murakami. Although some of his books had many problematic themes, I felt that some of his writing was truly beautiful. Spending time with you reminds me of a quote from his book: Kafka on the shore. 'If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets.' Some people say that the fact that people remember you, is proof that you are alive. If you remember me, that is all the proof I need, to know that I am alive.",

    alt: "It's the third day of Christmas ! Actually today is the day I wrote the previous letters hehe, sorry it's late. When I try to calm myself down, I imagine my heart as a big ocean. I imagine the waves that travel acrross the sea, as my feelings and emotions. The waves that crash on the shore, are the emotions that wish to be expressed. Sometimes the waves are big, and sometimes there is a storm in my ocean, but when I realize the ocean itself never moves anywhere, I can calm down. Lately, a new shore has formed on the other side of my ocean. This shore belongs to you :) As time has passed, a bridge has formed that connects my shore to yours, accross the ocean that is my heart. When I cross this bridge to come to your shore, the waves below push me along, to help me get there. But when you cross this bridge to come to my shore, the waves calm themselves down. They make sure you get accross, safely :) I hope this makes sense.",

    alt: "Hey ! it's the fourth day of Christmas :) I hope you don't get bored of quotes hehe because here's another one that resonates with me when I'm with you. 'In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.' - Albert Camus. It's almost funny how much this made sense to me this winter. I've always loved this quote, but it felt even more special with you. This winter, of 2023, in the midst of my lowest point this year, I found you. You are my invincible summer. You make any season feel like summer :)",

    alt: "Hey baby :) It's the fith day of Christmas already hehe. Today I wanted to talk about solitude. I really like being alone, at least that's what I thought. Being with you is like being alone, premium edition :) You really make everything better, even being alone. Maybe it doesn't make sense, but that happens alot around you. So many things I didn't think were possible, are possible with you. So many things that don't make sense, just work with you by my side. I feel that together, we can take on the world :)",
