    alt: "It's the second day of Christmas ! hmmm actually I have a confession to make. I used to quite like reading books by Haruki Murakami. Although some of his books had many problematic themes, I felt that some of his writing was truly beautiful. Spending time with you reminds me of a quote from his book: Kafka on the shore. 'If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets.' Some people say that the fact that people remember you, is proof that you are alive. If you remember me, that is all the proof I need, to know that I am alive.",

    alt: "It's the third day of Christmas ! Actually today is the day I wrote the previous letters hehe, sorry it's late. When I try to calm myself down, I imagine my heart as a big ocean. I imagine the waves that travel acrross the sea, as my feelings and emotions. The waves that crash on the shore, are the emotions that wish to be expressed. Sometimes the waves are big, and sometimes there is a storm in my ocean, but when I realize the ocean itself never moves anywhere, I can calm down. Lately, a new shore has formed on the other side of my ocean. This shore belongs to you :) As time has passed, a bridge has formed that connects my shore to yours, accross the ocean that is my heart. When I cross this bridge to come to your shore, the waves below push me along, to help me get there. But when you cross this bridge to come to my shore, the waves calm themselves down. They make sure you get accross, safely :) I hope this makes sense.",

    alt: "Hey ! it's the fourth day of Christmas :) I hope you don't get bored of quotes hehe because here's another one that resonates with me when I'm with you. 'In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.' - Albert Camus. It's almost funny how much this made sense to me this winter. I've always loved this quote, but it felt even more special with you. This winter, of 2023, in my winter this year, I found you. You are my invincible summer. You make any season feel like summer :)",

Being with you is like being alone, premium edition :) You really make everything better, even being alone. Maybe it doesn't make sense, but that happens alot around you. So many things I didn't think were possible, are possible with you. So many things that don't make sense, just work with you by my side. I feel that together, we can take on the world :)",

The world is better, brighter, and warmer place with you in it :) Maybe that is something that is easy to say, but let me back it up with some proof. Me! Without any hesitiation I can say you make my world a better, brighter and warmer place. If you shared even a tiny fraction of the impact you have on my life with someone else, it would make a world of a difference to their life :) Things are better with you, I am better with you, I'd be a different person without you. I like the person I am with you, more than that person :) Thank you for the sunshine that you bring into the world.",

I yearn for a time when we will smile at each other, with smiles full of wrinkles. Looking back at old pictures, reminiscing about the life we shared, and continue to share. Squinting at the pictures, trying to make out the other people in the pictures. I want to slow-dance with you, to songs that remind us of the times of our youth. I love you, I love us, and I love me but I also love who we will be in the future, wrinkles and all.",

Knowing I get to see you at the end of the week is a gift by itself :) Sometimes during the week my mind is quite busy. There’s emotions and thoughts flying left and right, and it can become really loud. But when I come to see you, or you come to see me, everything becomes quiet. Imagine It’s like very little voice in my head stops what they are doing, to pay attention to you. You have that kind of power with me :) See you soon baby <3",

    alt: "It's the 9th day of Christmas ! ‘On the 9th day of Christmas my true love sent to me ~ 9 ladies dancing” well, we are two ladies not nine, but we are certainly dancing. Our love is a dance. Sometimes the tempo is fast like salsa, but others it is slow like ballroom dancing. Dance has many different forms, each originating from some place different, as does our love. Some dances you know better than I, and likewise there are some I know better than you. But that doesn’t stop us from learning each other’s dances. Sure, it’s awkward waddling across that dance floor for the first time, but we aren’t afraid to be awkward, if it means we can dance with each other one more time. Besides, I like being awkward around you :)",

    alt: "Hmmm it’s the 10th day of Christmas already. I’m going to tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was some land. In the beginning the land had no water, it was so dry that there were cracks along the surface. It was dry for a long time. After some time had passed, people would come to the land, and pour water into the cracks. At first there was one, but in a few years there were many that would come to pour their water into the cracks. Suddenly, the land was no longer dry. Plants started to grow and animals came to visit. But sometimes, the land would become dry again. When the people stopped coming to pour their water. The plants would wither and the animals would leave. Not for long though. The land realized there was water, within itself. Deep within those cracks, there was water, so much water, the land had just not realized it until now. With access to the water within, the plants grew again, the animals came again to visit, and this time the land could share some of its water to the people who visited. The land is me, and my heart. At times I will share you my water, at times you will share me yours. I wish to make my land flourish, for you. I want you to see what beautiful flowers I have grown for you when you visit, what cute little animals I have taken under my wing. I want to grow tall trees for you, so that you can sit in the shade and enjoy the gentle breeze across your face. Btw it’s always summer when you visit :)",

But I do when I'm laying next to you :) Usually I need something on the background, and even then it can take hours. But with you by my side? Instant. You make me feel even more comfortable than I do alone. I don't know how you do it. I wish I could stay up a bit longer to see you fall asleep first. I want to tuck you back into the sheets when you move as you sleep. I want to give you kisses on the forehead whilst you sleep. But alas, I sleep too well around you ㅋㅋ You make me feel so safe.",

    alt: "12th day of Christmas already !! We’re halfway there hehe. Lets talk about encounters. Why do we have encounters? Why do I meet new people? Meeting people can be scary, many people I meet can be unkind, hurtful and have a negative impact in my life. But still, I meet new people. I muster up the courage to meet one more person, in the hopes that the next one will be different. Because amongst all those people I meet, there are some beautiful souls that shine above the crowd. Those beautiful souls are few and far between, yet somehow, your soul shines even brighter than the other beautiful souls. Gratitude is not enough to describe how thankful I am to meet you. Beautiful is not enough to describe the beauty of your soul. Knowing I met you, and that you are in life, I don’t worry about new encounters anymore. Who cares? I’ve already had, and have the best one :) My encounter with you.",

Let me explain :) The moonlight that shines from within you is beautiful. When the moonlight hits water in the ocean, your reflection is breathtaking. The light is bright enough to light up the night sky, but it’s not too bright that it hurts your eyes to look at the moon. It gives you a chance to appreciate all of its beauty :) Beauty is not the only way you are like the moon. When I look up at the night sky, there are millions of stars, but I always notice you first. On days when the sky is cloudy, maybe I won’t notice the stars, but I’ll always see you. Do you get what I mean? :) ",

We are both trans and on the asexual spectrum, and that comes through in his songs.\n\nMy heart and the earth share the same rule\nIt starts with love and it ends with you\nBut don't go outside, it's dangerous tonight\nWithout me right here by your side\n\nTake it slow, you'll know\nWhich way to go\nSew up your skull\nTake your time\nAnd we'll be just fine\n\nMissing pieces of my skull\nI'll sew on patches of my own soul\n\nWe’re all missing pieces of our skulls. But that’s okay :) I’ll sew on patches of my soul to your skull, and I hope you’ll sew on patches of yours to mine. I want my skull to be covered with the colors of your soul :)",

    alt: "15th of December ! Once again the weekend is almost here, I can rejoice hehe <3 You may sometimes wonder why I like to visualize things about you, or us. Our website, graph and new things I want to make for you are all visualizations of you, us, or the feelings I have towards you. But why? Well that’s a bit complicated. One reason is to immortalize this, all of this. The moments we share, the moments we shared, and the moments we continue to share, I’d like them to live for an eternity. Something you may have noticed, is that the way I visualize is complicated. That’s exactly what I want. The love I have for you is so endless, and complex. It’s not something that can be visualized easily in a simple diagram. If you were to look at a small part of my love, it would seem simple. The more you look at it, the more you dive into it you would find that, that small part of love leads to an endless world, like the wardrobe in Narnia. Each little part of my love leads to a different world, each world built on a different form of my love for you. At the same time, all of the worlds are connected to each other. It’s difficult to visualize this, but I create a visualization for each world, one at a time. I can connect these worlds through our site :) I can take my time, because new worlds are forming every moment I spend with you <3",

    alt: "Today’s the 16th day of Christmas :3 Actually today I wanted to talk about a song that might make us a bit uncomfortable, but there is a good ending, so stay with me. The song is called Mercury - By Bye Badman. This song describes my dysphoria quite well.\n\n난 가질 수 없는 것들을\n넌 가지고 있었어\n넌 항상 더 높은 곳에서\n빛나고 있었어\n난 가질 수 없었어\n너보다 부족해서\n더 멀게만 느껴졌어\n너와 나의 거리\n눈을 맞추면\n입을 맞추면\n눈을 맞추면\n입을 맞추면\n너와 함께면\n함께 한다면\n우리의 거린\n달라졌을까\n널 바라보면\n눈을 맞추면\n입을 맞추면\n깜깜한 밤 하늘과\n꿈에 젖어\n너와 함께면\n함께 한다면\n사라지는\n현실감\n\nThe beginning of this song talks about how you have something I don’t. That thing is your gender. I’m much more confident in my identity than I was before, and I put in work to continue growing that confidence. Despite that, sometimes, just sometimes. I feel jealous, dysphoric. And that creates distance, like the song says. But this isn’t a sad message. The song goes on to say, if our eyes meet, if our lips meet, if we spend time together, would the distance have changed? Yes it would, and it does. When I spend time with you, when I match my eyes to yours, when I put my lips against yours, the distance disappears. Dysphoria is real, but it isn’t something tangible. I won’t let it get in the way of us, I’ll continue to work on it, but you give me the strength to continue. Not only for us, but for me too. ",
