    alt: "It's the second day of Christmas ! hmmm actually I have a confession to make. I used to quite like reading books by Haruki Murakami. Although some of his books had many problematic themes, I felt that some of his writing was truly beautiful. Spending time with you reminds me of a quote from his book: Kafka on the shore. 'If you remember me, then I don't care if everyone else forgets.' Some people say that the fact that people remember you, is proof that you are alive. If you remember me, that is all the proof I need, to know that I am alive.",

I imagine the waves that travel acrross the sea, as my feelings and emotions. The waves that crash on the shore, are the emotions that wish to be expressed. Sometimes the waves are big, and sometimes there is a storm in my ocean, but when I realize the ocean itself never moves anywhere, I can calm down. Lately, a new shore has formed on the other side of my ocean. This shore belongs to you :) As time has passed, a bridge has formed that connects my shore to yours, accross the ocean that is my heart. When I cross this bridge to come to your shore, the waves below push me along, to help me get there. But when you cross this bridge to come to my shore, the waves calm themselves down. They make sure you get accross, safely :) I hope this makes sense.",

'In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.' - Albert Camus. It's almost funny how much this made sense to me this winter. I've always loved this quote, but it felt even more special with you. This winter, of 2023, in my winter this year, I found you. You are my invincible summer. You make any season feel like summer :)",

Being with you is like being alone, premium edition :) You really make everything better, even being alone. Maybe it doesn't make sense, but that happens alot around you. So many things I didn't think were possible, are possible with you. So many things that don't make sense, just work with you by my side. I feel that together, we can take on the world :)",

Without any hesitiation I can say you make my world a better, brighter and warmer place. If you shared even a tiny fraction of the impact you have on my life with someone else, it would make a world of a difference to their life :) Things are better with you, I am better with you, I'd be a different person without you. I like the person I am with you, more than that person :) Thank you for the sunshine that you bring into the world.",

I yearn for a time when we will smile at each other, with smiles full of wrinkles. Looking back at old pictures, reminiscing about the life we shared, and continue to share. Squinting at the pictures, trying to make out the other people in the pictures. I want to slow-dance with you, to songs that remind us of the times of our youth.

There’s emotions and thoughts flying left and right, and it can become really loud. But when I come to see you, or you come to see me, everything becomes quiet.

Sometimes the tempo is fast like salsa, but others it is slow like ballroom dancing. Dance has many different forms, each originating from some place different, as does our love. Some dances you know better than I, and likewise there are some I know better than you. But that doesn’t stop us from learning each other’s dances. Sure, it’s awkward waddling across that dance floor for the first time, but we aren’t afraid to be awkward, if it means we can dance with each other one more time. Besides, I like being awkward around you :)",

    alt: "Hmmm it’s the 10th day of Christmas already. I’m going to tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was some land. In the beginning the land had no water, it was so dry that there were cracks along the surface. It was dry for a long time. After some time had passed, people would come to the land, and pour water into the cracks. At first there was one, but in a few years there were many that would come to pour their water into the cracks. Suddenly, the land was no longer dry. Plants started to grow and animals came to visit. But sometimes, the land would become dry again. When the people stopped coming to pour their water. The plants would wither and the animals would leave. Not for long though. The land realized there was water, within itself. Deep within those cracks, there was water, so much water, the land had just not realized it until now. With access to the water within, the plants grew again, the animals came again to visit, and this time the land could share some of its water to the people who visited. The land is me, and my heart. At times I will share you my water, at times you will share me yours. I wish to make my land flourish, for you. I want you to see what beautiful flowers I have grown for you when you visit, what cute little animals I have taken under my wing. I want to grow tall trees for you, so that you can sit in the shade and enjoy the gentle breeze across your face. Btw it’s always summer when you visit :)",

You make me feel even more comfortable than I do alone. I don't know how you do it. I wish I could stay up a bit longer to see you fall asleep first. I want to tuck you back into the sheets when you move as you sleep. I want to give you kisses on the forehead whilst you sleep. But alas, I sleep too well around you ㅋㅋ You make me feel so safe.",

Meeting people can be scary, many people I meet can be unkind, hurtful and have a negative impact in my life. But still, I meet new people. I muster up the courage to meet one more person, in the hopes that the next one will be different. Because amongst all those people I meet, there are some beautiful souls that shine above the crowd. Those beautiful souls are few and far between, yet somehow, your soul shines even brighter than the other beautiful souls. Gratitude is not enough to describe how thankful I am to meet you. Beautiful is not enough to describe the beauty of your soul. Knowing I met you, and that you are in life, I don’t worry about new encounters anymore. Who cares? I’ve already had, and have the best one :) My encounter with you.",

Let me explain :) The moonlight that shines from within you is beautiful. When the moonlight hits water in the ocean, your reflection is breathtaking. The light is bright enough to light up the night sky, but it’s not too bright that it hurts your eyes to look at the moon. It gives you a chance to appreciate all of its beauty :) Beauty is not the only way you are like the moon. When I look up at the night sky, there are millions of stars, but I always notice you first. On days when the sky is cloudy, maybe I won’t notice the stars, but I’ll always see you. Do you get what I mean? :) ",

    alt: "15th of December ! Once again the weekend is almost here, I can rejoice hehe <3 You may sometimes wonder why I like to visualize things about you, or us. Our website, graph and new things I want to make for you are all visualizations of you, us, or the feelings I have towards you. But why? Well that’s a bit complicated. One reason is to immortalize this, all of this. The moments we share, the moments we shared, and the moments we continue to share, I’d like them to live for an eternity. Something you may have noticed, is that the way I visualize is complicated. That’s exactly what I want. The love I have for you is so endless, and complex. It’s not something that can be visualized easily in a simple diagram. If you were to look at a small part of my love, it would seem simple. The more you look at it, the more you dive into it you would find that, that small part of love leads to an endless world, like the wardrobe in Narnia. Each little part of my love leads to a different world, each world built on a different form of my love for you. At the same time, all of the worlds are connected to each other. It’s difficult to visualize this, but I create a visualization for each world, one at a time. I can connect these worlds through our site :) I can take my time, because new worlds are forming every moment I spend with you <3",

    alt: "Today’s the 16th day of Christmas :3 Actually today I wanted to talk about a song that might make us a bit uncomfortable, but there is a good ending, so stay with me. The song is called Mercury - By Bye Badman. This song describes my dysphoria quite well.\n\n난 가질 수 없는 것들을\n넌 가지고 있었어\n넌 항상 더 높은 곳에서\n빛나고 있었어\n난 가질 수 없었어\n너보다 부족해서\n더 멀게만 느껴졌어\n너와 나의 거리\n눈을 맞추면\n입을 맞추면\n눈을 맞추면\n입을 맞추면\n너와 함께면\n함께 한다면\n우리의 거린\n달라졌을까\n널 바라보면\n눈을 맞추면\n입을 맞추면\n깜깜한 밤 하늘과\n꿈에 젖어\n너와 함께면\n함께 한다면\n사라지는\n현실감\n\nThe beginning of this song talks about how you have something I don’t. That thing is your gender. I’m much more confident in my identity than I was before, and I put in work to continue growing that confidence. Despite that, sometimes, just sometimes. I feel jealous, dysphoric. And that creates distance, like the song says. But this isn’t a sad message. The song goes on to say, if our eyes meet, if our lips meet, if we spend time together, would the distance have changed? Yes it would, and it does. When I spend time with you, when I match my eyes to yours, when I put my lips against yours, the distance disappears. Dysphoria is real, but it isn’t something tangible. I won’t let it get in the way of us, I’ll continue to work on it, but you give me the strength to continue. Not only for us, but for me too. ",

    alt: "17th day of Christmas baby <3 Just over a week left until the big day hehe. I don’t usually talk about looks but I wanted to talk about it for today :) As you know, I am asexual. I can’t tell what is sexually attractive and what’s not. But I can tell what’s pretty. You are beautiful. I don’t know how to word it very well, so I take parts and of you and compliment them. Like your eyelashes, for example. It’s not just your eyelashes though. It’s the deep, rich hazelnut color of your eyes, whose reflection I get lost in. It’s the shape of your nose, the way the bridge sits perfectly between your eyes, the way it scrunches up a little when you smile, the way it flows so gently towards your lips. I can’t get over your lips. When you pout your lips sometimes it makes a rose, and it’s really pretty. There’s a mix of light pink and a very gentle red that, when put together they really do look like the petals of a flower. It’s your ears too. They are small and cute hehe but, more importantly they look pretty on the sides of your face. They don’t stick out so it’s not something everyone will notice, but the lines inside your ears flow elegantly. I like following where they start and where they stop. This is why I’m jealous of the people who get to see you in your day-to-day haha. I think you are beautiful, and that feeling grows. The more I spend time looking at you, the more ways I find that you are beautiful. I know very well what’s inside is more important, and I like talking about that more. But it’s also nice to talk about these things too <3 I’m so lucky to have someone so gorgeous by my side <33",

    alt: "Today is the 18th day of Christmas :) I use my flower analogy a lot to describe people. One way I can use it, is to see all the people in the world as a large bed of flowers, of course you are one of those flowers too. When so many flowers are bunched together, it’s difficult to pick out one from the rest. But yours? I would notice from a mile away :) It’s not that the flower is big, no no. The flower stands out in a different way. On the outside, you can see it has light pink petals. The tone of pink is so light, in fact one might mistake it for white. On the inside of the flower, you’ll find luminescent pollen, each grain shining tiny beams of light from within. These beams of light bounce onto the brightly colored petals. Each beam is small, but when millions of grains of pollen are shining together it lights up the whole flower bed in an instant. All this to say, the flower is beautiful :) inside and out. Even if some other flower had the same petals as yours, they wouldn’t shine the same way that you do. I love you. ",

I’m writing this a bit earlier than the 1 month mark, but even still it feels like a lot has happened in this short time. When time is moving quickly I like to take a moment, to look back and appreciate what has just happened. So, join me in doing so today :) I don’t think I’ll be able to fit everything in here, but I’ll fit as much as I can. On Tuesday the 21st of November, we started dating :) We brought each other flowers and expressed our feelings for one another, on a bench in front a building that you liked. When we held hands as we walked, that was the first time in 7 months that I’d held yours. Walking around with my hand in yours, felt as natural as the first time :) Then there was my birthday. You made the greatest birthday anyone could ever ask for, and I cried a lot with gratitude. The gifts, the surprise, all of the planning, things I never would of thought I’d get to experience before. Then came the next weekend. I came to your workplace for the first time, and we went to 남부터미널 to see all of the anime merchandise. I can’t get over the way your face lit up at some of the items there :) It made me so happy to have shown you one of the places I love. On the Sunday of that weekend you fell ill. When you told me you couldn’t leave your house I dropped everything to come over. We watched an episode of paradise kiss that night. That was an extra special night for me. Although you told me not to come, you still let me :) It felt like I came closer to you that night. The Tuesday after that weekend ahahaha, I won’t talk too much about it, but it was a good evening nonetheless. The weekend after, we spent 3 days together in a row :) that’s a record for us hehe. On the Friday we had an evening out with your friends, sure there were some difficult moments, but there were fun moments too <3 The weekend after that one is this one baby, I wonder what we’ll do on this one hehe.

What I can do, is remind you that when it is all over you will have someone who will be proud of your endeavor. I’ll give you an extra push on the back when you need it, and I’ll swap that out for a pat on the back when it’s over :) Some days, or even many, may feel like a battle but every one of those days you make it through is a battle you’ve won. You’ve won countless battles, the battle today is one more you can add to that record :) I’ll be by your side, but at the same time I’ll be waiting on the other side to celebrate and talk all about your victory.

Nothing will have to be forced this Christmas, because it’s with you :) I can let down my walls and truly enjoy such a special day. I hope it snows this Christmas. I’d like to walk through the snow with you on Christmas morning. I’d like to make angels in the snow next to you, and draw penises on them after. But I also want you to feel at home this Christmas. I don’t usually spend Christmas with my family, but you do. When you first told me you wanted to spend Christmas with me, I was very happy, but I also had the thought of “what should I do to make up for the fact that she’s away from home”. Maybe you don’t mind, or maybe you feel at home already, or maybe there’s not much I can do, but if there’s the smallest possibility that I could make you feel more at home I’ll jump at it. So if there is something you’d like to do, or there’s something you’d like me to do, or there’s something you’d like us to do that would make you feel more at home don’t hesitate to ask baby <3 I’m not kidding I’ll go to extreme measures to make sure it happens hehe.",

How can time move so fast, yet each day feels so slow ㅋㅋ At his time of year I like to make a report. It contains milestones I’ve achieved this year, things I’ve learned/improved upon, and things I should work on in the next year. As I’m writing it somehow I realize our relationship fits into all three of those categories. It’s certainly a milestone, it’s also the milestone I’m most proud of. It’s also something I’ve learned from. There’s a lot that I learn from my time with you. I learn about you, about us but I also learn about myself. When I’m in a relationship, that’s when I’m most vulnerable and it’s where I see sides of myself that wouldn’t come up to the surface if I wasn’t in one. That’s a place where I can learn what I need to work on, and what I have improved upon. I’m grateful you give me that opportunity. That leads me onto the third category, things I should work on in the next year. This one is an odd one, because as I am in a relationship with you, I will always be looking for opportunities to grow, it doesn’t matter if its the new year :) For example, I know my love, and how I like to express it but I think there is a different way to love each person in this world. That doesn’t mean I’m going to learn the way for every person but I’m learning the way for you. Every second we spend together is another page in my book called how to love Charlotte :) I work towards the day that it is no longer a book, and instead it is a library <3 I love you, and I’ll learn every single way that there is to love you.",
